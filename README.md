# Project specific notes

This project is to demonstrate the folder junction link watch bug.

## Description
Project is setup with two config folders, _config-dev_ and _config-prod_. In the _src_ folder we are creating a junction link to one of those folders. Then on the page we show a value from the config.

Folders:
```
config-dev  <--------\
config-prod          |
...                  |
src                  |
 |-config --junction-/
 ...
```

## How to reproduce
1. To setup the _config_ folder run the `init-link` script (`npm run init-link`).
   This will create a link in the: _./src/config_ folder to the _./config-dev_ folder.
2. Start server (`npn start`)
3. Make minor change in _./config-dev/index.json_ (for example add an additional _!_) to verify that watch work.
4. Change to prod config using the `switch-to-prod` script (`npn run switch-to-prod`)
5. Note that text on page hasn't changed, even reloading the page wont update the text.
6. Make minor change in _./config-prod/index.json_ and notice how watch no longer work.
7. Make minor change in _./config-dev/index.json_ and note that the changes made in previous step now is pushed to browser.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
